## 护符对照表
[护符对照表](https://github.com/b1ueb1ues/b1ueb1ues.github.io/blob/master/amulet.csv)

  
## stat
- Level 80, circle node(50/50) adventurer.
- Dojo(30/30) altar(30/30) 
- Have all facilities (include limited) (include dracolith, except fafnir) in level 30.
- Equiped level100 str 60% dragon except water unit, which use "Dragonyule Jeanne". if you don't have "Dragonyule Jeanne", water unit will lose about 4% DPS.
- Equiped MUB 5star element weapon

## WP
- Most common used WP is RR

### first WP
- Equiped MUB level100 "Resounding Rendition". (Since WP is additive with Dragon, 15% str provide less than 10% damage. And for most character, skill damage is more than half of all damage.)

### second WP
- Equiped MUB level80 "Fresh Perspective" for sword user.
- Equiped MUB level100 "Crystalian Envoy" for blade user.
- Equiped MUB level100 "Kung Fu Masters"+ MUB level80 "Flower in the Fray" for axe user.
- Equiped MUB level100 "Crystalian Envoy" for lancer.
- Equiped MUB level100 "Flash of Genius" for wand/bow/dagger characters.
- remove resist WP select for 3\*. (all offense setup now)


## commen combo chain the simulation use:
- sword: c3+fs, c2+fs(for Xander and Albert)
- blade: c5+fs(failed) (that kind of technique introduced by me) [reference](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av38956687/)
- dagger: c5+fs(3hits) (you can hold FS reverse to change your direct in the c5 jump)
- axe: c5+fs / plain c5 (if mentioned that unit don't use fs)
- lance: c5+fs / c5+fs(failed) (if mentioned that unit don't use fs)
- bow: plain c5 or c4+fs or c1+fs
- wand: c5+fs(failed)
- staff: c5 (no frame difference between c5 and c5fsf)

## Not take into consideration: 
#### (means that you should add some score yourself to unit have that kind of abilities)
- Ex-skills(Co-abilities)
- Shapeshift
- Phraeganoth/Physian/Demon Bane
- Slayer's Strength/Striker's Strength except for special page

## Conditional dps is reference to :
#### (means that you should reduce this part of dps to unit have that kind of abilities by your own opinion)
- Full HP = Strength/Crit
- HP 70% = Strength/Crit
- Flurry Strength/Crit
- Flurry Debilitator
- 30 Hits = Energy Level Up
- Affliction and damage boost from affliction. One type of Affliction can proc 3 times in one simulation. (You can't proc any affliction to HBH, at most 5 poison to HMC, at most 3 burn to HMS)
- Trigger Last Offense at simulation start

## special mechanics
- Consider other teammember have a total of 3500 dps.
- Consider every 5 team energy stacks to provide 2 skills(other 2 dps) that boost 2500 damage for each into team dps.
- Simulate unit that have bleed 1000 times, and show the average DPS. 
- Consider only dragon once at middle of fight for dragon claw.
- Consider break punisher to have 15% efficiency
- Consider od punisher to have 35% efficiency

## why 3500 team?
- The underestimate of team dps is intend.
- This chart is not always for people who aimming at HDT, someone just want to know who can deal more damage to decide who to invest. I don't think eli/melody is good for investment outside HDT, their most power need no equip to archieve.
- It's pretty easy for those who only care about HDT preformance to do teamdps / 3500 * whateverYouWant
- Buff decrease more after reduce active action time. (btw so does bleed). Unlike Xania will lose 50% damage if you take off her 50% damage time to dodge. Buff is likely to lose 75% damage when you take off 50% active action time, because buff loss 50% uptime by the mean time the action buffed by this buff lose 50%.
